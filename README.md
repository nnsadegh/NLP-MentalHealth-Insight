# NLP-MentalHealth-Insight
This repository hosts the NLP-MentalHealth-Insight project, an innovative approach using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect concealed signs of anxiety and depression. Inspired by the work of Wolohan et al. (2018), our project extends their methodology to not only identify linguistic traces of depression but also to recognize subtle indicators of anxiety, especially in contexts where individuals may not explicitly discuss their mental health due to societal stigma or personal reluctance. The repository contains datasets, code, models, and documentation detailing our journey from data acquisition to model implementation and testing. Our work utilizes advanced NLP techniques, including sentiment analysis and emotion classification, to analyze text data sourced from various mental health-related online communities. This project aims to contribute to the development of more effective diagnostic and monitoring tools in mental health, offering valuable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers.
